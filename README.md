## About This Journey

Like Princess Anisphia—born into privilege but without magic—I found myself managing enterprise platforms without the foundational skills I needed.

Instead of accepting it, I'm rebuilding from the ground up.

**Current Mission:** Transform from AI-Driven Software Engineer to Software Engineer through systematic learning and deliberate practice.

**The Goal:** Build things that matter, with skills that transfer anywhere in the world.

### **Core Principles**

```typescript
const journey = {
  from: "Managing without understanding",
  to: "Building with confidence",
  method: "Fundamentals first, no shortcuts",
  deadline: "240 days until HCMC",
  commitment: "3 hours daily, 1 commit minimum",
};
```

**Learning Path:**

- ✅ TypeScript fundamentals (years of experience)
- 🔄 React without AI assistance (current focus)
- 🔄 Spring Boot & Java (building alongside React)
- 📋 System design & algorithms (queued)

## 📚 Philosophy

**On Learning:**

> "The difference between a dirt house, a tutorial house, and an original house is 9 months of deliberate practice."

**On Shortcuts:**

> "7/10 local job success means nothing if the knowledge doesn't transfer internationally."

**On Growth:**

> "Building without AI isn't about pride—it's about passing interviews in rooms where Claude isn't allowed."

## 🎮 Side Quests

When not coding:

- 🏠 Self-hosting homelab (learning DevOps through pain)
- ⛏️ Running Minecraft server (understanding distributed systems via creepers)
- 📖 Reading technical books in English (building transferable knowledge)

## 🌍 The Vision

**Short-term (8 weeks):** Complete Helldiver Campaign, build portfolio-ready projects

**Mid-term (10 months):** Return to HCMC, join company with international standards

**Long-term (2-3 years):** Transfer to Singapore/EU, work with world-class engineers

**Why?** Because like Anisphia researching magic in a world that said she couldn't—I'm building engineering skills in an environment that said PM was enough.

It's not about the destination. It's about proving that determination beats natural talent.

_Inspired by a princess who researched magic without having any. Building software engineering skills without the typical CS background. Same spirit, different domain._
